# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: OCTOBER 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**:Started an EIT Management app. Set up a meteor and react project. Did the first page and the css associated.

**Thoughts:**  I am new to everything here: Meteor and React. I Learnt about Reacts rendering. How it takes the function or element and the destination to be rendered. I also learnt a little bit of how the meteor react flow is.
